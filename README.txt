Data Mining II: Advanced Topics
===================================================================================================

This project has been envisioned as a comprenhensive overview of Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques applied to the UCI HAR dataset, which tracks the movements of participants accross different movements such as walking or laying. Its purpose is to gather insights from this motion data while using different families of algorithms such as:

- Data understanding & preparation
- Outlier detection
- Imbalanced learning
- Dimensionality reduction
- Classification
- Regression
- Time series analysis
- Sequential pattern mining
- Clustering
- Explainability
